I'm a passionate entrepreneur, developer, and [skeptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeptical_movement) trying to change the world with open source software.

For the last 20 years, I've had the good fortune of being involved in just about every stage and role of multiple ground-breaking open source projects and technology companies.
