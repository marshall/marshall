### heya ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate entrepreneur, engineer, and [skeptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeptical_movement) creating meaningful software for people at scale.

For the last 30 years, my career has spanned the gamut of open source software, high growth startups, and the space industry. My code has been deployed to millions of devices around the globe, and been to space on more than a dozen satellites.
